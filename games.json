Wifi & Data is made up of a board, playing figures, a dice and a deck of 60 knowledge/situation/action cards. The game board shows Wifi symbols (ladders) and cables (snakes) that determine the players' performance when stepping on them. Additionally, when stepping on a symbol representing the 3 different types of cards, players need to take the corresponding card and answer it or fulfil a given task. Only when giving an appropriate answer / fulfilling the task, players can move their figure the number of positions shown by the dice. The winner is who first reaches the final position on the board.
